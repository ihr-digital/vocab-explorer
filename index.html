        <h1>Introduction to the Vocabulary Explorer</h1>

      <section>
        <div id="intro">
<p>The interactive part of this site has two main pages: <a href="https://ihr-webmaster.github.io/vocab-explorer/skos-explorer.html">a SKOS explorer</a>, which allows you to generate SKOS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System">Simple Knowledge Organisation System</a>) for a particular term in the vocabulary, and a <a href="https://ihr-webmaster.github.io/vocab-explorer/vocab-explorer.html">a vocabulary explorer</a>, which allows you to browse and search the RHS Vocabulary,</p>

<h3>SKOS explorer</h3>
<p>The SKOS explorer allows you to see the SKOS markup for any term in the RHS vocabulary. Simply navigate to the term whose SKOS represetntation you would like to see and click on it.</p>


<h3>Vocabulary explorer</h3>
<p>Use this page to navigate the RHS Vocabulary of British and Irish History. You can use the show/hide button at the top of the page to show the tree alone (which is easier for navigation) or the tree with non-preferred and related terms.</p>
 
<p>The terms are usually listed in order:</p>
 
<p>Use the + (plus) and – (minus) keys to broaden and narrow the terms.</p>
 
<p>The term to be used is in <span class="term-intro">bold</span>, eg <span class="term-intro">Technology</span> is a preferred term.</p>
 
<p>Terms <span class="usedFor-introduction">in grey italics</span> are non-preferred terms which have a single term that should be used instead. For example <span class="usedFor-introduction">Inventions</span>. Click on any non-preferred term to see the preferred term.</p>
 
<p>Terms in grey non-italic are non-preferred terms which have more than one term to be used instead.</p>

 
<p>Terms in <span class="usedFor-info">red</span> have more than one preferred term and these must all be used as well. Click on the red term to see a drop-down list of all the terms which must be used; blue terms in this drop-down list are in different parts of the tree from your current location: click on the light blue term to go to its position in the tree. The same term may appear more than once in this list reflecting the terms multiple locations within the tree. For example, for <span class="usedFor-info">Philosophy of history</span> you should use one or more of <span class="usedFor-introduction">Historiography</span> and/or <span class="relatedTerm-info">History: study, understanding and use of</span>.</p>


<p>Terms <span class="relatedTerm-info">in blue</span> are related terms. These are terms which you might wish to consider using alongside the preferred term; light blue terms in this drop-down list are in different parts of the tree from your current location: click on the light blue term to go to its position in the tree. The same term may appear more than once in this list reflecting the terms multiple locations within the tree.</p>
